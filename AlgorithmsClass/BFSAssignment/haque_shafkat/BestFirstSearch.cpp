//This is the best first search branch and bound function. It takes the array of items and the file to write to.
//First, it creates the root. Then it visits the "yes" child and check if the current weight is <= capcity and if the profit is > maxProfit, and so that maxProfiti is changed. It then checks the bound and is put on the queue if the bound is greater than the maxprofit. It then creates the "no" child and visits it. It also checks if the bound is > than the maxProfit and updates accordingly. The line "if(v.bound > maxProfit)" expands v and checks it if promising. If this does not pass through, then a non promising node was hit, or a leaf node and so we increment to keep the number of leaf nodes visited in the queue. After, the optimal set is found and the data is written to the output file.
